# Pirate Jam 14
This is the game I made for the Pirate Jam 14 in Jan 2024. It was made in around two weeks.

# Tools
- Engine - Godot v4.2
- Audio - Musescore 4
- Art - Aseprite

# Code
I _do not_ recommend using the code in this as a reference. If you want to see how something is done here or there, you might find something useful, but there's a lot of hacky things sticking everything together since it was made in a game jam rush.

Reference the code at your own peril.
