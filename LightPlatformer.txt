How it relates to theme:
	You have to spread the light to progress. In this case, the "It's Spreading" is a positive affect, and allows you
	to progress. You die after a short time in the dark, so the light needs to be spread in order for you to exist


You start with nothing, but there are mirrors and objects that can help spread the light you interact with

After first few levels, gain access to light core

Light core:
	Creates a small area of light around you
	When places on a valid object, powers it
	Some objects can increase the light produced by the core

Dark:
	The world is enveloped in dark, and it's very dangerous to you (for some reason I haven't figured out yet)
	The dark kills you very quickly, and will never be used as a platforming challenge
		(e.g. I don't ever want a puzzle that's timed based on how long you're in the dark, that's gross.)
	
	There is a very small grace period when light disappears that dark is not active, but similar to above,
	it will not be a puzzle element. This is just to reduce frustration and will never be required to utilize.


Inspiration:
	Obviously OneShot is the first game that comes to mind, as you control Niko who has the world's "Sun" which is a bulb
	that gives off light and is a beacon of hope to people. In that game, you don't really use the Sun as a puzzle
	element and it's more of just a story tool though.
	
	ElecHead is also a huge inspiration, as it's a game where you are a lil dude who can detach his head to power nearby
	electronics to platform.

Puzzles:
	
	Simple puzzle - You must drop the core to power a lamp that lights your path to go grab a key. Then you have to come
	back to grab the core and leave with the key to finish the level.
