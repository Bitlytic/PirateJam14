Theme: It's Spreading

Platformers:
	
	* Light based platformer where you have a bulb or some battery/power that you can spread the light
		- You can't move in the dark
		- Spreading light on certain elements will cause them to spread light elsewhere or activate misc.
	
	- Power to corrupt/affect
		- You have some ability to throw a projectile to spread some sort of corruption or plant
		- That affects the scenery/platforms and allows you to complete puzzles/platforming

Arcade:
	
	- Farming with blight
		- You want to keep plants close together, but they can become blighted and spread that to each other
		- Plants synergize, which incentivize you to keep them together, but can cause blight to spread faster
	
	- Tower defense with plants
		- Towers are plants, but can become blighted, spreading it to nearby towers
